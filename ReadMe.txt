Crumb Journal

The aim of this website is to promote my thesis application Crumb Journal, 
which focuses on introducing individuals to the early stages of journaling. 
However, it is not an accurate representation of the final product due to the 
fact I have not established what the visualizations of the widgets will be and 
all of the descriptions. The website can more accurately be described as a 
place holder until I have a more clear understanding of what the visualizations 
are.
